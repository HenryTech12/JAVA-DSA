# Java DSA Library

Welcome to the Java DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Library! This library provides implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Java, designed for educational purposes and practical use. 

## Features

- **Data Structures**:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, and Circular)
  - Stacks
  - Queues (Regular and Deque)
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
  - Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
  - Graphs (Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix)

- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort)
  - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Algorithm)
  - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
  - Recursion Examples

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher)
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-dsa.git
   cd java-dsa
