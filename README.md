## âœ¨ Features

### Data Structures

The library includes implementations for the following data structures:

- **Arrays**: Static and dynamic array implementations.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks**: Stack implementation with standard operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`).
- **Queues**: Regular queues and double-ended queues (Deque).
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and more.
- **Heaps**: Min-Heap and Max-Heap for priority queue operations.
- **Graphs**: Implementations using adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.

### Algorithms

The library features a variety of algorithms, including:

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- **Searching Algorithms**:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Algorithm

- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - Knapsack Problem
  - Longest Common Subsequence

- **Recursion Examples**: Various problems demonstrating the use of recursion.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
